# Metamask setup

## Connecting MetaMask to Neatio Mainnet Network

### Installing MetaMask
MetaMask can be downloaded on Chrome and Firefox, Opera and Brave, or on iOS and Android if you’re a mobile user. For the purposes of this tutorial, we’ll use the Firefox version, but the instructions will be more or less the same for every platform.

Firstly, you’ll want to head over to the MetaMask [Download](https://metamask.io/download.html) page. From there, select whichever platform you’re using, and follow the steps to install it on your device.

Next, follow along with the setup specified by the app. Go ahead and click **Create a Wallet**. NOTE: Write down the backup seed phrase somewhere secret (preferably not on an Internet-connected device). Without this phrase, your funds can’t be recovered if your device is damaged or lost. Confirm that you’ve written them down on the next page.
And that’s it! You should now see your wallet, ready to send and receive funds.

### Metamask Network Setup

You might notice straight away that we’re still dealing with an Ethereum Network. Let’s change that. We need to access the **Settings** to point the wallet towards **Neatio Network** nodes.

On the **Settings** page, we want to locate the **Networks** menu.

We want to click **Add Network** in the top-right corner to manually add the Neatio Network using the details below.
